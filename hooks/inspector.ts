// The agent inspector (v0.6.0): `/cockpit agents` and `/cockpit agents <task>`. A read-only view of what Cockpit already
// holds: the swarm's tasks and the Run Ledger's agents. Nothing here keeps state, schedules or decides anything.
//
// Authority. Why a queued task cannot start is asked of the swarm's own admission rule (`admissionReason`), whose answer is
// worded here and nowhere re-derived; there is no second scheduler. A suggestion is information: it names what a person or the
// commander could do, never does it, and is only offered when the recorded state supports it. A security hold, a failed
// verification and a release NO-GO are never cleared from here.
//
// Honesty. A figure is shown only when the host reported it. An effort level Cockpit requested is not an effort level the
// engine applied; a result an agent reported is not a result anyone verified; a task nobody has seen move has no "last activity".
// What is unknown says so.
