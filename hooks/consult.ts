// Opus consultation admission for the SONNET_LED profile.
//
// Sonnet builds, Haiku scouts, Opus reviews, NobodyWho advises. In this profile
// Opus is never the main loop and never a background model: it is one bounded
// architect/reviewer subagent, admitted on a stated ground, given a concise
// evidence packet instead of the conversation, and asked for one decision.
//
// This module is pure. It reads facts the host already reported (the person's
// prompt, the files the task touched, the failure streak, the swarm) and
// answers whether a consultation may start, whether the task needs one before
// it can finish, and what the consultation is told. It never spawns and never
// calls a model or a router: the session router (router.ts) is asked at the
// start of a task, never at admission, and never decides it.
//
//   - GROUNDS. architecture, security, repeated-failure, asked, release. A
//     ground holds on evidence, not on the main loop's say-so.
//   - MANDATORY. asked, release and security-sensitive files: the task is held
//     below 100% until a consultation has returned and the main session has
//     adjudicated its advice (verified it, pass or fail).
//   - BOUNDS. One live Opus at a time; an unchanged problem is consulted once;
//     a failed consultation is retried at most once; three per task.
