// The Activity Field: a bounded, in-place tape of real activity above the
// prompt, and the surface the crawler physically traverses.
//
// The field is drawn as text first. Real events are laid out left to right, each
// at a known cell, and those cells are the anchors the crawler walks between.
// Nothing here is a scrollback line: the field is re-rendered in place, one or
// two rows, with a third only while a real NobodyWho receipt needs a junction.
//
// The rules that keep it honest:
//   - It only ever draws events that exist. `tapeOf` is handed the real event
//     list; an empty list draws nothing at all, so a session with no activity has
//     no field rather than an empty placeholder.
//   - Narrowing drops whole events and never invents one. A very narrow terminal
//     shows the newest event alone, which is still true.
//   - Old events fade and collapse out of the layout; they are never appended.
//   - The NobodyWho graph exists only for a real receipt. `graphOf` returns null
//     for a prune or decision that was not observed, so no junction and no branch
//     is ever drawn from imagination.
