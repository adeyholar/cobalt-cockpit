// Two things are held here. First, every hook that can refuse an action carries
// a `.catch` error handler that refuses in its place: the engine skips a hook
// that fails, and a skipped guard lets the action run. Second, a pass-through
// hands the engine its own event unless the hook really changed it. Neither is
// about the drawing: they are the difference between a guard and a decoration.
